                            Hi, <b><font color=red>r3dd3r</font></b> here! You might recognize me from the Die2Nite
                            official World Forums where I am one of the <b>Oracles</b>, or maybe from a town we played
                            in together (there have been many!). This is my guide for Scouts, geared especially for
                            those players planning long range expeditions (<b>18 km</b> or more from town). However, I
                            hope Scouts of all kinds can find some useful tips and advice in this guide.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>To start out, a quick disclaimer:</i> I am at the end of the hero unlock tree, with over
                            400 Hero days. This puts me in a very lucky position, compared to most heroes, as far as
                            unlockable perks are concerned. Don't worry though! As long as you have unlocked up to <i>Second
                            Wind</i> (151 days or more), you are thoroughly capable of following every piece of this
                            guide.

                        <p>
                            I would say no, it's all about timing your expeditions so that they benefit the town most.

                        <p>
                            Metacoalitions should be able to use their scouts well enough in any town to get the best
                            use out of them. However, for the solo Scouts or small groups of Scouts playing Random or
                            Jump towns this information may help.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Well let's face it--if you are in a random town, it's very unlikely that you will end up on
                            the Season ranking, so in most cases, being too cautious will just be a little bit too
                            boring.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>*</b> <b><i>Why go out at all?</i></b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Somewhere out there are Architect's Chests, even the super rare Sealed Architect's Chests!
                            There are buildings beyond 18 km that will add Expert Expeditions distinctions to your soul,
                            if interacted with (i.e. explored). Even better, if camped, these buildings will also grant
                            blueprints the town could otherwise not obtain until the point that they would be useless to
                            the town. Again, speaking primarily about random towns, the only other way to obtain these
                            blueprints without Scouts camping them early on would be around the time of the town's
                            death. In almost any case, obtaining blueprints without Scouts camping these distant
                            buildings would require multiple players using multiple weapons and boosters to attempt it,
                            especially any later than Day 1.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Go as far out as you can for Fame, Adventure, Blueprints and Distinctions!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Anyone can camp the buildings close to town, but not everyone can get out as far as 18 km,
                            or more, if they're not a scout. No other class could reasonably attempt it Day 1.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <font color=red>If you are unlucky enough that the town fails around Day 3-6, at least
                                you'll have gotten a good trip out of it... and hopefully some Extreme Expedition
                                points!</font>

                            <b>And, if the town lives till Day 10-16+, you will have returned with blueprints often rare
                                and often not otherwise retrieved!</b>
                        </p>

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Well, here's the real meat of the guide!
                        </p>

                            Now you'll know your possible destinations. Plan a path as close to the edge of the largest
                            section of highlighted area on the map (this depends entirely on the random factor of town

                            Zone upgrades are not often needed at this distance, and as their class bonus, Scouts can
                            negate a fair chunk of zombies (around 12, from testing). This bonus will let you camp
                            without the <b><font color=red>worrying number of zombies</font></b> penalty, particularly
                            on Day 1 when zombie populations are the lowest.

                            Didn't find a building? <b><i>No sweat!</i></b> Once you are this far out, you don't need a
                            building to camp! Normal zones should provide "limited, but tempting chances," and with <b>2-3</b>
                            <b>AP</b> spent upgrading and/or <b>1</b> <b>AP</b> for tombing you can get yourself to

                            If you found another food item while scavenging on the way out to your campsite and want to
